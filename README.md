# Traffic Violation Detection

## I. Introduction

Street violations are one of the problems that often or even always occur in big cities. 
Traffic violations are a major contributor to death. How not, in traffic violations that result in death, the impact is terrible. 
For example, if someone has an accident, especially a fatal accident, it is very likely to happen. 
So, from this matter we have an idea to make a simple AI for checking traffic violation on a small scale (e.x: road marks)

## II. Prequisities

1. First, we determine the pre-trained models that will be suitable, hence we will use openVINO models from intel. 
We don't use our own models since openVINO models is more than enough.
2. Second, we determine the libraries for our AI, that includes: openCV (for computer vision), numpy (for math problems), matplotlib (for plotting), imutils (for image processing), tkinter (for GUI), pillow, and imageio (for image handlings).
There are also some packages that we use, which is: openVINO (for integrating pre-trained models), and easyOCR (for OCR).
3. Third, we will make our AI using pre-trained models from openVINO so it can be a final product using libraries and packages that we already mentioned above.
4. Fourth, we do some testing to the pre-trained models to confirm that they perform optimally, as we expect.
5. Lastly, we will do some finishing touch to the AI so we can use it in general.
